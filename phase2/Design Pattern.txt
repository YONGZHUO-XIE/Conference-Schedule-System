Design Pattern Facade in Controller System:Controller System plays a big role to connect our gateway class SaverReader and the entire ControllerMenu. Controller System hides the complexities of the system and provides an object that can access the whole system. This also decrease the dependencies on subsystem. Design Pattern Dependency Injection in Controller Menu:Dependency Injection has been used in the entire Menu Page. All submenu will receive the Controller System class and the Scanner class from Main Menu instead of creating these objects by their own. Design Pattern Factory in SaveReader (Gateway):Factory pattern to decide which type of factory to return to the user. It promotes less coupling and less duplicated code.
