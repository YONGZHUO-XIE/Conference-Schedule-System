When anattendee signed up for an event, the speaker(s) of the event and all other attendees will be added to this attendee'sfriend list. So do the speaker(s) and other attendees, that is, once an attendee signed up for the event, all attendeesand speaker(s) in that event will automatically have each other in their friend lists. Users can only message the userswho are in their friend list. Even though someone messaged you first, but you cannot reply if he is not in your friendlist. Note that once the user has been added to your friend list, he will not be removed regardless of what happens(including canceling events).List of features:1.Mandatory extensions(1)There will now be many types of events. A one-speaker event is the same as a "talk" from Phase 1. You can have multi-speaker events, like a panel discussion, and no-speaker events, like a party. Events can last as long as you want. You can measure the duration of an event in hours, or minutes. You get to decide.(2)Events can be canceled by at least one organizer.(3)VIP attendees and VIP events.(4)Organizers can also create Speaker accounts, Attendee accounts, and any other type of user accounts that are in your program.(5)Each event has a maximum number of people who can attend it. This amount can be set when the event is created and also changed later, by an organizer. Your program should check the maximum capacity for the room where the event will be held, and prevent the number of attendees from going above the room's capacity2.Optional extensions(1)Allow the same users to log in and select which conference they want to participate in. Here, participation means viewing and signing up for events. The inbox can be conference-specific, or one general inbox for all messages from all conferences to that user. You decide which one.(2)Enhance the user's messaging experience by allowing them to "mark as unread" and delete after reading them.(3)Have the program produce a neatly formatted program or schedule for the conference that users have the option of "downloading" (outputting it as html, pdf, or similar).(4)Allow the system to support additional user requests (e.g. dietary restrictions, accessibility requirements) where organizers can tag a request as "pending" or "addressed". All organizers see the same list of requests, so if one tags a request as addressed, all other organizers can log in and see that.3.Create your own extension(1)Users answers one of security questions when they register. They can reset their password by answering their security question.Improvements since Phase 11. We realized that our controller classes depend on entities after we received feedback from phase1. For example, weimport entity packages in controller classes, which violates Clean Architecture. Therefore, we moved some of the code touse case classes and re-wrote some code. Now controller classes do not interact with entities directly, but via use caseclasses.2. We created abstract class such as Event and implemented such as VipEvent and Normal event, since they follow a Is Arelation 
3. As suggested in Phase1's feedback, all print messages for text UI has move to different Presenter classes. The class UserInterface (The name of it has change to MainMenu) has 
move to Controller layer.  There is an one-to-one corresponding between a class in Presenter and a class in Controller Menu.
